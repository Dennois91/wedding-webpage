It is a serene and spiritual ceremony led by the priest, focusing on the bridal couple, with guests observing quietly. It lasts around 45 minutes.</p><p></p><p>The legal ceremony, lasting around 10 minutes, will be conducted at the wedding venue and marks the official, legally binding moment of our marriage, overseen by a wedding official and translator.</p><p></p><p>In keeping with Serbian tradition, guests will receive a small decorative item upon entering the venue (such as a band across the arm). Traditionally, one or two girls (family members) will be decorating each guest. It is customary to offer them a small voluntary amount of cash gift in return.</p><p></p><p>After the legal ceremony, there will be a photo session with the bridal couple whereby each guest/family group will be photographed individually. This is also a chance to say your congratulations and leave a card if you wish to do so.</p>",
